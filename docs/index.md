Machmeter is an open source tool for performance benchmarking of Cloud Spanner. This repository contains Machmeter code, usage instructions and a few example use-cases. Users can clone any of these use-case and edit them to imitate their specific use-case.

## What does Machmeter do?
 - **Simplifying setup for performance test**: This tool provides an easy-to-use CLI which can set up an integrated environment to test on Spanner quickly with pre-built sample test scenarios. It simplifies operations such as setting up a Spanner instance, setting up client metrics collection, setting up a Kubernetes cluster and running an at-scale JMeter template using leader-follower configuration.
 - **Randomized data generation for complex schema(s)**: Machmeter provides samples for common use-cases to configure JMeter to generate randomized data for a given schema. These templates use JMeter APIs and are GUI driven.
 - **Base templates for new use cases**: Templates can easily be extended/modified to adapt to a customerâ€™s specific use case.  Moreover, you can also quickly implement custom scenarios within this tool with little java code/editing existing scenarios.

### Project Structure

- [Machmeter](../machmeter): this is a maven project containing the code for the tools.
It has broadly 2 modules, an __Orchestrator layer__ and __Plugins__. 
  - __Orchestrator Layer__: this layer handles the input and reads the provided 
  config. Further, based on the input, it decides which plugins need to be
  executed.
  - __Plugins__: this layer contains plugins for various stages of the benchmarking.
    - [MachmeterStatePlugin](../machmeter/src/main/java/com/google/cloud/machmeter/plugins/MachmeterStatePlugin.java):
    This plugin sets up the local directories for preserving __Machmeter__ state.
    - [InfraSetupPlugin](../machmeter/src/main/java/com/google/cloud/machmeter/plugins/InfraSetupPlugin.java):
    This plugin executes terraform scripts to setup the Spanner Instances
    and GKE cluster for Jmeter clients.
    - [DdlPlugin](../machmeter/src/main/java/com/google/cloud/machmeter/plugins/DdlPlugin.java):
    This plugin is for loading data into the Spanner Instances.
    - [ExecutePlugin](../machmeter/src/main/java/com/google/cloud/machmeter/plugins/ExecutePlugin.java):
    This plugin executes the benchmarking tests provided in the use-case.
  - [Terraform](../machmeter/src/main/resources/terraform): This folder contains
  a terraform script for setting up Spanner Instances and GKE clusters. It also 
  contains config files for the Grafana Dashboard.
- [Use-cases](../machmeter//usecases): all the sample use-cases reside into this folder
categorized into different folders.
