### Entertainment Movies Template

Implements a IMDB like database with containing multiple tables to capture information such as `actors`, `directors`,
`movies`, `genres` and `roles`.

All of these tables are interlinked via interleaved/foreign key relationships.

This template demonstrates loading data into a subset of these tables and focuses on a query patterns localised to a
set of tables within the larger database.

For performance testing, it has example of using JMeter variables and properties to generating data that is required
in the performance run.
